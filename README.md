A GitHub Action that enables optimized and flexible continuous integration suites.

Sloth is a GitHub Action designed to streamline and optimize continuous integration suites by serving as the final arbiter for the success of the entire suite. It patiently waits for all other checks to conclude, providing its seal of approval only if all triggered jobs were successful. Sloth bridges a functionality gap within GitHub Actions, allowing for required checks to be dynamic, a feature not natively supported.

## When to Use Sloth?

* **Conditional Triggers with Mandatory Success**: Sloth is invaluable when you need to trigger a check conditionally, but mandate its success if triggered. For instance:
  * Linting GitHub Action workflows selectively when they are modified.
  * Running checks only for services modified within a monorepo.
* **Large Matrix of Checks**: Sloth simplifies the management of extensive check matrices, alleviating the burden of maintaining which checks are required.

## Configuration

To integrate Sloth, follow these steps:

1. **Create Workflow**: Sloth runs as a separate workflow. See the example definition below for a copyable workflow file. 
2. **Set as Required Check**: Configure Sloth as the primary (often sole) required check in your branch protection rules. This ensures that the entire suite is contingent upon Sloth's validation.

## Example Workflow

```yaml
name: Sloth

on:
  pull_request:
  merge_group:

jobs:
  sloth:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    steps:
      - name: Sloth
        uses: lendable/sloth@main
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```
